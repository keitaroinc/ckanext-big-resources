# ckanext-big-resources

CKAN extension that overwrites the upload and download of the resources. 
The extension breaks the resources into chunks and streams the response. This extension is usefull if We want to configure the chunk size of upload and download in order to use the server resources (RAM and CPU) in more efficient way.


## Requirements


Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version    | Compatible?   |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| 2.6 and earlier | not tested    |
| 2.7             | not tested    |
| 2.8             | not tested    |
| 2.9             | Yes           |


## Installation

To install ckanext-big-resources:

1. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example:

     . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate

2. Clone the source and install it on the virtualenv

    `
    git clone https://github.com/keitaroinc/ckanext-big-resources.git

    
    cd ckanext-big-resources
    
    python setup.py develop
    
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    `
    
3. Add `big_resources` to the `ckan.plugins` setting in your CKAN
   config file (by default the config file is located at
   `/etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini`).

4. Restart CKAN. For example if you've deployed CKAN with Apache on Ubuntu:

     sudo service apache2 reload


## Config settings

The following settings (which set the upload and the download chunk in bytes) should be present in the ckan.ini file.

	ckanext.big_resources.chunk_upload = number_in_bytes
    ckanext.big_resources.chunk_download = number_in_bytes

If thease settings are not found in the ckan.ini than the default value vill be set by the extension. The default value for both upload and download of the resource is 2048



## Developer installation

To install ckanext-big-resources for development, activate your CKAN virtualenv and
do:

    git clone https://github.com/keitaroinc/ckanext-big-resources.git
    cd ckanext-big-resources
    python setup.py develop
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


## Tests

To run the tests, do:

    pytest --ckan-ini=test.ini

## Notice

This extension can not be combined together with a cloud storage CKAN extension (like ckanext-cloudstorage or ckanext-s3filestore). If the CKAN is extended with a cloud storage extensions than the upload and download of the resources is taken over by the cloud storage extension and the  ckanext-big-resources becomes obsolete.
